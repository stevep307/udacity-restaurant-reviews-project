## Implementation details

This project written according to the [Restaurant Reviews project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1090/view).

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.

## How to run application

To get started developing right away:

* check the version of python with `python -V`
* if you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
* for python 2.x spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.)
* for python 3.x spin up the server with `python3 -m http.server 8000`
